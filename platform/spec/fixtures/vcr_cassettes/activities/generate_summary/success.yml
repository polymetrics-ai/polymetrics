        Generate a comprehensive Markdown-formatted summary based on the following:\n\n**User
        Query**: \nSales summary\n\n**Data Results**:\n---\n- id: 1\n  amount: 100\n-
        id: 2\n  amount: 200\n\n\n\n\n**Requirements**:\n- Structure the summary using
        Markdown with these sections:\n  ## Analysis Overview\n  ## Key Insights\n  ##
        Data Quality Notes\n- Use bullet points for lists\n- Highlight important trends/patterns\n-
        Flag any data inconsistencies or missing values\n- Maintain professional tone
        for business users\n- Keep insights actionable and data-driven\n\nYou must
        format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given \"JSON Schema\"
        instance.\n\n\"JSON Schema\" is a declarative language that allows you to
        annotate and validate JSON documents.\n\nFor example, the example \"JSON Schema\"
        instance {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"description\": \"a list of test words\",
        \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}}\nwould
        match an object with one required property, \"foo\". The \"type\" property
        specifies \"foo\" must be an \"array\", and the \"description\" property semantically
        describes it as \"a list of test words\". The items within \"foo\" must be
        strings.\nThus, the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted
        instance of this example \"JSON Schema\". The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\":
        [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}}} is not well-formatted.\n\nYour output will be parsed
        and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all
        fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!\n\nHere
        is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing
        markdown codeblock:\n```json\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"summary\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"description\":\"Markdown
        formatted summary containing data analysis, key insights, and quality notes\"}},\"required\":[\"summary\"],\"additionalProperties\":false}\n```\n\n"}],"model":"google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free","temperature":0.7,"n":1}'
