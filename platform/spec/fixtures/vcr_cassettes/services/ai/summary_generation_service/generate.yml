        Generate a comprehensive Markdown-formatted summary based on the following:\n\n**User
        Query**: \nProvide quarterly sales summary\n\n**Data Results**:\n---\n- :id:
        1\n  :content: ''Q1 sales: $1.2M''\n- :id: 2\n  :content: ''Q2 sales: $1.5M''\n\n\n**Additional
        Context**:\nFocus on growth trends\n\n**Requirements**:\n- Structure the summary
        using Markdown with these sections:\n  ## Analysis Overview\n  ## Key Insights\n  ##
        Data Quality Notes\n- Use bullet points for lists\n- Highlight important trends/patterns\n-
        Flag any data inconsistencies or missing values\n- Maintain professional tone
        for business users\n- Keep insights actionable and data-driven\n\nYou must
        format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given \"JSON Schema\"
        instance.\n\n\"JSON Schema\" is a declarative language that allows you to
        annotate and validate JSON documents.\n\nFor example, the example \"JSON Schema\"
        instance {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"description\": \"a list of test words\",
        \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}}\nwould
        match an object with one required property, \"foo\". The \"type\" property
        specifies \"foo\" must be an \"array\", and the \"description\" property semantically
        describes it as \"a list of test words\". The items within \"foo\" must be
        strings.\nThus, the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted
        instance of this example \"JSON Schema\". The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\":
        [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}}} is not well-formatted.\n\nYour output will be parsed
        and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all
        fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!\n\nHere
        is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing
        markdown codeblock:\n```json\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"summary\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"description\":\"Markdown
        formatted summary containing data analysis, key insights, and quality notes\"}},\"required\":[\"summary\"],\"additionalProperties\":false}\n```\n\n"}],"model":"google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free","temperature":0.7,"n":1}'

        two quarters of data (Q1 and Q2). A more comprehensive analysis would require
        additional historical data to identify long-term trends and seasonality.\\\\n*
        \  **Missing Quarters:** Data for Q3 and Q4 are missing. This limits the ability
        to perform a full year-over-year comparison or forecast future performance.\\\\n*
        \  **No Granularity:** The data only provides total sales figures per quarter.
        Further analysis could benefit from breaking down sales by product, region,
