## Product Requirements Document (PRD) for LLM-Powered ETL Platform

### 1. Title
**LLM-Enhanced ETL Connector Platform**

### 2. Overview, Goals, and Success Criteria
**Overview**: This product is an ETL platform that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to facilitate user-friendly data extraction and transformation from various APIs to multiple destination databases based on available connectors. The LLM agent will interpret user queries and generate the necessary connections and SQL queries to extract data, presenting the results in a tabular format.

**Goals**:
- Enable users to query data from any available API using natural language.
- Automatically identify available database connectors and establish connections based on user-defined parameters.
- Allow for data joining across multiple connectors.

**Success Criteria**:
- At least 80% of user queries are successfully interpreted and executed without manual intervention.
- User satisfaction score of 4 or above on a scale of 5 in post-interaction surveys.
- Reduction in the average time taken for users to extract data by at least 50%.

### 3. Purpose and Context
**Problem Statement**: Current ETL solutions require technical knowledge to set up connections and execute queries. Users often struggle with writing SQL or understanding the underlying data structure.

**Target Audience**: Data analysts, business intelligence professionals, and developers who need to extract insights from various APIs without deep technical expertise in SQL.

**Market Context**: The demand for intuitive ETL tools is growing as organizations seek to democratize data access. Competitors like Airbyte provide robust solutions but lack natural language processing capabilities for querying.

### 4. Features and Relative Sizing
- **LLM Agent for Query Interpretation (XL)**: Interprets user input and generates SQL queries.
  
- **Dynamic Connection Creation Based on Available API Connectors (L)**: Automatically identifies available API connectors and establishes connections based on user-defined parameters.

- **Data Extraction and Presentation (M)**: Queries the selected database and presents results in a table format.

- **Multi-Connector Support (L)**: Identifies multiple connectors and allows data joining.

### 5. High-Level Feature Descriptions
- **LLM Agent for Query Interpretation**: Utilizes Langchain.rb to process natural language input, converting it into structured queries for the identified database.

- **Dynamic Connection Creation Based on Available API Connectors**: Users can specify parameters, and the system will automatically detect available API connectors to establish connections dynamically.

- **Data Extraction and Presentation**: Executes the generated SQL queries against the selected database and formats the output as a markdown table for easy readability.

- **Multi-Connector Support**: Facilitates complex queries involving multiple data sources, allowing users to join datasets seamlessly.

### 6. Feature Details (UX Flows, Wireframes, Acceptance Criteria)
- **User Flow**:
  1. User inputs a natural language query.
  2. LLM agent interprets the query.
  3. System identifies available API connectors based on user input.
  4. Connections are established as needed.
  5. SQL query is executed against the selected database.
  6. Results are displayed in a table format.

- **Wireframe Ideas**: A simple interface with an input box for queries and an output area for displaying results in table format.

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The system must return results within three seconds of query submission.
  - The output must be formatted correctly as a markdown table.
  - The system should accurately list available API connectors before establishing a connection.

### 7. Experiments
- **A/B Testing of Query Formats**: Test different prompt structures to optimize LLM performance in interpreting user queries.

- **Hypothesis**: Certain prompt structures will yield higher accuracy in query interpretation.

- **Measurement of Outcomes**: Track the accuracy of responses based on user feedback.

### 8. Technical Requirements
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Backend: Ruby on Rails with Langchain.rb
  - Database: Support for multiple databases based on available connectors (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).

- **Infrastructure Requirements**:
  - Hosting on cloud platforms (AWS/Azure).
  - CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or similar tools for deployment automation.

### 9. Data and Analytics Requirements
- Data will be stored in various databases according to user-defined connections with structured schemas reflecting source data.

- Analytics tools like Google Analytics or Mixpanel will be integrated for monitoring user interactions and performance metrics.

### 10. User Interface (UI) Requirements
The UI should be clean and intuitive, featuring:

- An input field for natural language queries.
  
- A results area displaying tables with pagination if necessary.

### 11. Performance Requirements
- Target response time under three seconds for query execution.
  
- Support up to 100 concurrent users without degradation in performance.

### 12. Security Requirements
- Ensure compliance with GDPR standards regarding user data handling.
  
- Implement role-based access control to restrict sensitive operations.

### 13. Open Questions
- What specific types of APIs do users expect to connect with?
  
- Are there additional API connectors that should be prioritized?

### 15. High-Level Release Plan
Features will be rolled out in phases:

1. Core functionality (LLM agent, basic querying).
2. Multi-source support with dynamic connection creation from available APIs.
3. Enhanced UI features based on beta feedback.

### 16. Future Considerations
Future enhancements may include:

- Additional source API connectors (e.g., social media APIs, financial data APIs).
  
- Advanced analytics features such as predictive modeling based on extracted data.

### 17. Success Metrics (KPIs)
Quantitative Metrics:
- User engagement rate (target >70% active users).
  
- Churn rate <10% within the first year post-launch.

Qualitative Metrics:
- User feedback scores averaging above four out of five on satisfaction surveys related to ease of use and functionality.

This PRD serves as a comprehensive guide for the development team, outlining all necessary components needed to successfully build the LLM-enhanced ETL platform while adhering closely to the specified tech stack of Langchain.rb and supporting dynamic connections from various available API connectors based on user requirements.
